This is a repo for some helper scripts that I use for NGS data delivery.

count_barcodes.py is a very simple script for counting the number of occurrences of each DNA sequence barcode used to tag different samples. It's mostly meant to be used when the results of FASTQ de-multiplexing are unexpected and need to be checked in more detail. 

assisted_delivery.py is for delivering files to customer project directories. It uses some assumptions about directory structure.

TODO:
	- pretty-print barcode statistics
	- when prg cannot find your given project ID, present a list of available ones
	- remove index from file names altogether
	(done) - change the 'interactive mode' into a 'dry run' which would be more useful
	(done) - change directory permissions at the end of the script (chmod g+w *.*)
	(done) - allow user to specify sample names for non-multiplexed runs
