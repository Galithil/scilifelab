This is a repo for some helper scripts that I use for NGS data delivery.

count_barcodes.py is a very simple script for counting the number of occurrences of each DNA sequence barcode used to tag different samples. It's mostly meant to be used when the results of FASTQ de-multiplexing are unexpected and need to be checked in more detail.
